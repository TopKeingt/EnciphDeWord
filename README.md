# EnciphDeWord [![Python 3.6.5](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.6.5-yellow.svg)](http://www.python.org/download/)
*EnciphDeword is a basic python project that I created based on [Cipher System using SpreadSheet](http://www.mastermathmentor.com/mmm/Crypt.ashx) by @Stu Schawartz*

###### This project intended for beginners since all python files were created with easy to read layout.
